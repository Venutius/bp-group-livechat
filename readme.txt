== Description ==

This plugin provides basic live chat within BuddyPress groups. Each Group admin can enable a group TinyChat room, available for all group members to view and post.

The Live Chat area provides an ajax chat room which displays the most recent messages along with timestamps and usernames.  It also has a "who's online" area which shows other group members viewing the Live Chat page.  "Super Admins" can spy on the chats of all groups.

Currently the chat supports text chat and the sharing of links. I'm interested in adding further features but would like to see some user requests for the same.

This plugin was originally created by David Cartwright and ownership has been passed to Venutius.

== Installation ==
