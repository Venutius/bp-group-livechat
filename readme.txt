== Description ==

This plugin provides basic live chat within BuddyPress groups. Each Group admin can enable a group LiveChat room, available for all group members to view and post.

The Live Chat area provides an ajax chat room which displays the most recent messages along with timestamps and usernames.  It also has a "who's online" area which shows other group members viewing the Live Chat page.

Currently the chat supports text chat and the sharing of links. I'm interested in adding further features but would like to see some user requests for the same.

This plugin was originally created by David Cartwright and ownership has been passed to Venutius.

This plugin runs from your own server, no chat data leave your site. This has has the benefit of minimizing your exposure regarding user privacy and GDPR, however chat will be as responsive as your server and can be laggy. User conversations are stored for one month then deleted.

== Installation ==

Download and upload the plugin to your plugins folder. Activate.

On the front-end, go to a Group > Manage > LiveChat and select 'Enable Group Livechat' and save.
A 'LiveChat' tab will appear on the main group nav. Click to start chatting.
